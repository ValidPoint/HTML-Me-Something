                This is Chico. He is a full-bred Chihuahua who is of the tender age of 16. He suffers
                from hearing loss and partial blindness due to his age. He has a tendency to get
                confused, which makes him wander off at times. He also tends to hobble while he walks
                and is suspicious of others. Despite all these problems, Chico is a wonderful dog and
                the best friend anyone would want to have.

                Chico was last seen somewhere in Sioux Passage Park, possibly attracted to a
                carnival they had up there. It is my belief that someone inticed my dog with promises
                of food and fun before snatching him away from me. But I suppose I could be acting
                a tad paranoid. It has been over a week since I last saw Chico and it's making me feel
                sad and desperate. It is odd to see Chico wander off so far; usually, he stays real
                close to the house. Whoever ends up finding him, I promise them a big reward for 
                their endeavors.

                If you do plan to search for Chico, there are a few things you should probably know
                first. First, Chico is a timid and shy dog, so he will probably try and run away from
                you when he sees you. If you happen to have food in your hands, though, he will become
                your best friend and be more open with you. Second, Chico likes to burrow under different
                items, especially blankets. If you happen to see a cover of some sort in the area, look
                under it; he just might be there. Finally, you may notice that he doesn't have a collar
                on. That's because every time I try to put one on him, he takes it right off. Do not be
                afraid to approach him; he has had his rabies shot.
